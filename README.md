- I have chosen this example because the "floating" effect of those ghosts attracted me and I would like to incorporate such an animation into my project. By seeing the example, and according to the coding skills I have learnt so far, I think I can mainly use *for loop* and *calss* to acheive a similar effect. I believe this will be a positive challenge that allow me to not only practise my current coding skills, but also explore further functionalities and practical techniques.
